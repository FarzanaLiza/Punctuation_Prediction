    "YOUTUBE_TEXTS = [\"hello and welcome back to our study of the dhammapada today we continue with verses 262 and 263 which read as follows which means not from giving speeches or from beauty of appearance is a person called respectable or of good form of good form if they are jealous miserly and deceitful for whom these things are fully cut off fully cut off cut off at the root destroyed such a person who has anger removed or has has anger removed and is wise such a wise one with anger removed that person is called sadhu rupa of good form so this verse was taught to a group of monks who were living in the buddhas monastery or came to the buddhist monastery and saw all these young novices novice monks who had ordained and taken the the ten precepts so they were like monks in training and they saw them learning the dhamma from other monks learning how to chant and recite the dhamma its the first step is memorize it so they probably did just a lot of memorization the great thing about memorizing is it its like taking the books with you then you can always refer back to them its not of course a replacement for actual practice but if you are keen on practice memorization is quite valuable for your practice to be able to remember exactly what the buddha said on this topic or that topic but what they really noticed and were really interested in was the fact that after these novices learned the dhamma from the various monastic teachers they then waited on them did many services for them like they would sweep out their cooties and bring them toothpaste toothbrushes and uh clean up after them cleanup and and bring them food and you know many different things and also just overly overall disrespected the monks and paid reverence to them and this group of monks thought to themselves oh well we know the dhamma as well heres what we should do well go to the buddha and well say venerable sir we are well versed in the dhamma dont tell these these novices they shouldnt memorize the recite the teachings without having learned it from us tell them to come and learn from us if we if we say that to the buddha then this is their words then we will get we will well have much gain come to us this is what they were thinking its may be a bit of a simplistic telling of the story but uh it is it should be fairly familiar the idea of people seeking out gain so they went to the buddha and they told them the buddha this and the buddha thought to himself its true this what they say is actually proper i mean its proper that students wait on their teachers but these guys are just doing it for gain their their only desires for gain so i better teach them something and he taught them this verse and the relation with for the verse is that the word sadhu rupa means something like respectable so it relates to how they wanted to be respected they considered this a great gain for them to be well respected to have people honor them and revere them and soon so they thought of themselves as they didnt even actually consider whether they were worthy of it they just wanted it and they saw how to get it so a simple story the lessons from this especially relating to meditation practice the first is really the the lesson of the story regarding things like gain the buddha taught the four worldly damas gain praise fame and pleasure and it made may seem like kind of a worldly teaching not a simple basic teaching much more suitable for people who are nt dedicated to meditation practice it doesnt relate to how to do walking how to do sitting but when you think about it it has very much to do with the reasons why we practice we practice in order to see through the addictions and attachments that we have we ultimately come to practice to be free from suffering and the secret to suffering the secret to the cause of suffering is that it relates to our desire for things that cant satisfy us the essence of the practice is about seeing as you know the three characteristics and what these relate to is all of these worldly things why cant we find happiness why cant we find satisfaction in the world even though were always seeking out gain were always seeking out praise were always seeking out fame or or a good name social status right i want to be the people that everyone looks up to and honors and reveres and soon and and pleasure i mean ultimately all were looking for is pleasure its the the most deep seated of all desires even with all of that why is it that we dont find satisfaction why arent we happy and so you can see it takes a bit of aa maturity in order to be able to see through that and so thats the first thing we are reminded of with this story is how easily human beings or beings in the world are led astray seeking out things that are not worth seeking out the buddha called them the an aria seeking out these things it can often be a challenge for meditators to wonder why they are taking all this time when to torture themselves to do something that sso unpleasant and hard when they could easily just as easily go back and enjoy all the pleasures that they think exists in life and so it takes a real maturity to see through that to be able to commit yourself to withdrawing to trying to see beyond or find happiness that lies beyond these very enticing um very familiar sources of what we think are happiness and so the practice of mindfulness is what allows us to see is it allows us to gain this maturity and to see through it because we learned that when we learn not through intellect intellectual learning what we learn through our practice that gain is coupled with loss praise is coupled with blame high society is coupled by loss of society happiness pleasure is coupled with pain impermanent while pain doesnt last forever neither does pleasure gain is only possible because of loss you can only gain if you velo stand this is how we go through samsara gaining and losing when we die losing throughout our lives but ultimately losing everything when we die and then we have to gain again and were stuck in this cycle thats not nearly as satisfying as we believe it to be so the other part of this lesson the other thing we can learn from the story is how not only do you become blind to the fact that these things cant satisfy us its actually even worse than that what we learned from what were reminded of should be fairly familiar to us but what this story reminds us of is a good example of is how it also corrupts our mind not only does it blind us or are we blind to the impermanence were also led astray to the extent of harming others manipulating others when you look at the story it sits a case of people doing something quite terrible it doesnt seem so bad but its manipulation using the buddhas teaching for their own personal gain and and manipulating people in order to do it saying that lets make lets make sure all these students come to us and then and why not because we think we can teach better but because then it will be to our benefit it will it will allow us to satiate or agreed and so its a simple its a silly perhaps example but it does exemplify this problem that not only do sensual pleasures and worldly gains of all kinds fail to satisfy us they also lead us to to great potential for evil to harm others we leads what leads people to kill thats what leads people to steal its what leads people to be jealous the buddha brings it up he really drives it home for these monks reminding them that they re jealous they are they are deceitful he includes that so the in some ways the verse seems tailored for the audience but its a reminder of the sorts of things that come from this incessant search for worldly pleasure because the problem is that when your e engaged in seeking out pleasure theres no room for clarity theres no room for seeing the actual experiences our mind our seeing of things is so very weak the objects that we see is so fleeting and immediately are the habits asserts itself and were off in judgment in reaction in clinging engraving we lose sight of the experience theresa really important framework to understand how how this this whole process works that mindfulness is really just all about that its about having the strength of mind to really experience something to have the clarity of mind to really see what s there and its not actually complicated its not like its something that you dont already know intellectually its just that your mind perceives things with such an uh a proclivity to react we cant see without reacting we cant hear without reacting we cant feel without reacting we cant think without reacting we have a bad attitude bad habits of interaction and mindfulness is really just all about changing that letting you see that seeing is just seeing it seems trivial why should ofcourse i know seeing is already seeing ah but thats not how you thats not how you approach these things seeing for you is so much more seeing as oh the feeling is so much thinking what do our thoughts give us they make us lost in so much greed so much anger so much delusion conceit and you know all kinds of things and so its quite a simple thing and yet it su hits its completely the opposite of our ordinary way of approaching things that leads us to seek and to chase and leads us to to blindness we dont see how were not being satisfied because were just not with our experiences were not watching were not watching what is were looking for what we what isnt yet were looking for what we dont yet have or how to get rid of what we have constantly put the push and pull of seeking out good things running away from bad things were never actually aware we dont ever have that clarity and so it leads us to not see that they re satisfying but also leads us to not see how harmful to ourselves and others this becomes how we not only harm ourselves but we harm others as well and it can lead people on on terrible paths drug addicts are perhaps the best example the clearest example but theyre the natural conclusion the natural result of extreme blindness due to desire you can be so addicted to drugs that you will steal or kill or lie and cheat and all kinds of things just to get what you want so thats i think the the thing that this story reminds us of is why were here were really there really is something good and worth encouraging in in the practice of meditation because you cant find happiness elsewhere theres nothing in the world that can make you happy all the things all these thoughts about this will make me happy or that will make me happy they are wrong you can be reassured that leaving here and going and seeking out those pleasures wont lead to happiness its not capable of it the other lesson relates to the verse and and sort of the the thrust of the verse and it really deals with the difference between the appearance of good and actual goodness and so its useful for us to understand that the type of goodness that were seeking out is actually its actually on a deeper level even than the actual meditation but our ordinary idea of goodness might be something like knowing what s right and wrong maybe even believing whats right and wrong we would say well ive studied all the buddhist teachings and i know whats right and wrong and andi really believe in it as well and thats thats good and useful umit it can help you to make the right decisions in this life but its also something you can forget its something you can fail in because you might know something and in the spur of the moment forget it the way you see buddhists sometimes slap at a mosquito because it was they were just too too it was just too quick and i keep the precepts ive ive promised to keep them but uh but its better its better that you know of course if you know whats good and whats bad it leads people to do good things and not do bad things but the buddha teaches here he drives on the point that these monks and by extension we can think of of all of us and people who are practicing well these monks were in the category of those who had nt cut off anything yet they knew all these things but they had no right to assume that they were worthy of any respect because they had nt actually cut anything off they had nt actually become anything special and that really is an important distinction in buddhism and so whats useful for us is to understand that the goal is not just to come here and learn some intellectual things or get some good useful practices in our life its to actually free ourselves so actually actually come to the point where we cut off these bad habits where we actually have no potential to crave or to hate or to uh be be confused or be or misunderstand reality so the three things we have cut we can cut off greed we cut off anger we cut off delusion and this only comes by seeing what we call the four noble truths so it only comes when your meditation gets to the point where you not only appreciate say the three characteristics but you truly see them you come to the point where your mind says all phenomena all the risen phenomena are impermanent not in you know its not its not a voice line in your head but theresa realization like you just get it and all it takes is that moment where the mind gets it for there to be this experience of letting go and its that experience that realization and that letting go that is called its true death in buddhism death in buddhism is not the death of a human being because human beings are when they die theyre born again of course its just conceptual the reality is well they keep living they keep experiencing the body just changes but is where there s real the real death and its not the death of a person or an individual its the death of of evil the only thing that can truly die is our defilements our our bad habits or misunderstandings are seeking out of things that cant satisfy us and it dies because we ve sound something that actually truly can satisfy that is true peace true happiness you feel that peace when the mind lets go there can be no doubt after that about the true peace where true peace lies and so its considered the true cutting off this is a person who s called sadhu rupa your e not sadr up a rupa is form right so it can refer to your physical form if you have beauty and and physical appearance the buddha said no thats not true nor is it because you give fancy fancy speeches that make people impressed or your e able to recite all of the buddhas teachings or something like that said when you cut off all of these bad habits of seeking out things that cant satisfy you or worse manipulating others to get what you want and when you have no more wonder dos a when you have no more anger because you see that the rest he theres nothing theres nothing worth getting upset about the experiences dont have that quality of the man experience doesnt have the quality of being a desirable or unpleasant experiences are either seeing or hearing or smelling or tasting or feeling or thinking and thats all they are and you start to see that you start to see that if you pay attention and so thats what mindfulness is for it gives you the tools to allow you to pay close attention and have clear attention and to see things as they are and the mother said that sort of person is wise that is what true wisdom is made how we a wise person is someone not who knows many things or can recite many things like these monks could but one who knows for themselves and sees for themselves just very simple things someone whose perspective is clear seeing is just seeing and they have no dependency on seeing certain things hearing feeling they are what they are they live independent thats where true peace true happiness and true greatness true respectability you want to be worthy of respect thats what makes you worthy of respect and you want to respect someone respect those people so thats the teaching of the dhamma panda verse for this week thank you all for listening\"]\n",
